For the sake of brevity, the part of the code related to obtaining and importing the raw data is omitted:

More information about the raw data:

1. Pitch-level data from Baseball Savant pulled into a MySQL database and then queried for the analysis. For more information, please refer to Bill Petti's baseballr package.
2. Retrosheet Game Logs can be downloaded for each season from www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/index.html
3. The playerids were compiled from a combination of Baseball Prospectus and the Lahman database.
